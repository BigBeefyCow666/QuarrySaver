# QuarrySaver
A python script to create a list of waypoints of immovable blocks where you want to build a quarry or world-eater.

# Prerequisites
1. Python 3 (ofc)
2. nbt python library (pip install nbt)
3. ray python library (pip install ray)
All other libraries should already be installed (I think, let me know if that isnt the case).

# How to use
Download the [python script](QuarrySaver.py) and install the prerequistes.

Take a litematica area selection of the area you will build your quarry/world-eater.

Note down the smallest (most negative) x, y and z values of the schematic placement.
In this case the smallest x value is 208, y -51 and z 843.

Now save the schematic and run the QuarrySaver.

The program will first ask for the litematica file, locate the schematic file you saved ({minecraft folder}/schematics).
Now enter the coordinates that you noted down from the origin of the schematic.
The program will then show you the blocks it will look for, by default these are all immovable blocks.
Then you can add/remove blocks from this list using the next prompts.
Next select what minimap mod you are using, VoxelMap (v) or Xaero's (x).
The program will now run.

When it is done finding blocks, it will ask you for a file to save the waypoints to, a .txt if using Xaero's, or a .points if using VoxelMap.
You can save this file anywhere and then copy the waypoints across, or select the waypoint file for the server/world (be warned this WILL ERASE the file entirely!)

Relog and the waypoints should now be in your world!

# Preformance
## Limitations
This current version is SUPER memory intensive, as for each worker (instance that allows multicored python program) you need a copy of all the variables, including all the nbt and block data of the schematic. 
I wanted to scan an insanely huge area for fun (1056 by 4200 (cough mexico) with a height of 150), which had 670,509,007 blocks. If I tried to run it with all 10 cores on my CPU, it would VERY quickly fill up all 16GB of RAM and crash. BUT, I did lower it's core count to four, and it just scraped by using all my memory. It took 7 minutes and 35 seconds to find all 3,941 immovable blocks in this area, and it was running at under half speed.
Because of this problem I plan to create a new version that saves things temporarily to disk to minimise memory use, but this will be complicated.

## Compared to JKM and SweetBaboo's
OK, so my goal was to make it run faster than JKM and SweetBaboos's version, so lets look at the numbers. These tests were made using the same litematica file, same settings and same machine:

QuarrySaver:
```
Read and analysed 286,858,440 blocks in 0:01:10.415282 (70.415 seconds) finding 5244 illegal blocks.
```
JKM and SweetBaboo's:   
```
Total elapsed time: 278.3692 seconds
Load time: 220.3033 seconds
Process time: 28.3054 seconds
```
So 278.4 / 70.4 = 3.955 â‰ˆ 4 times faster! So I'd say my project was a success!

# Credits
I got the idea to make this after seeing JKM and SweetBaboo's version they made and how slow it was, and wanted to improve the quality of life of building a quarry (and to prove that python can be fast if written right).
Credit to the decoding algorithm for litematica files goes to the [litemapy library](https://pypi.org/project/litemapy/), which I just copied the source for decoding, de-bloated and made work in a ray cluster.
